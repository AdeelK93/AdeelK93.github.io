I'm currently a data analyst at [Molecular Rebar Design](http://www.molecularrebar.com/) with a degree in Chemistry from [The George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/). In our lab, I work with data along every step of the way, from data acquisition to ingestion to visualization to reporting. I use R and JavaScript as my tools of choice for analysis and automation.

I'm writing this blog mostly as a journal for myself, but also to document what I've learned and the projects I've worked on, on the off chance that it might help somebody else. I know, at least for me, reading other peoples' accounts of how they fixed a particular problem or overcame some obstacle has lead me to learn about things that I hadn't even previously considered.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about my work!
